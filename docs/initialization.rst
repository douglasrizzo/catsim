Initialization Methods -- :mod:`catsim.initialization`
======================================================

All implemented classes in this module inherit from a base abstract class
:py:class:`Initializer`. :py:class:`Simulator` allows that a custom initializer be
used during the simulation, as long as it also inherits from
:py:class:`Initializer`.
