Item Response Theory Functions -- :mod:`catsim.irt`
***************************************************

Item Response Theory is a group of statistical tools created with the purpose of measuring latent traits, like personality traits or knowledge in specific areas. IRT allows for the creation of a measuring instrument (the test), under which every examinee may be positioned and compared with others. The masuring instrument is created by items, which can be most commonly represented as tasks in a test.

On the mathematical domain, IRT allows us to calculate the probability with which an examinee might answer an item correctly. For that both items and examinees are modelled using numerical parameters. This allows for the estimation and analysis of examinees proficiencies on the same scale as items difficulties. It also allows for the quality of items to be judged by the values of their parameters.
